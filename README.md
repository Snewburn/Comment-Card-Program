# Comment-Card-Program

This program is built with Visual Basic (justBasic version). 
The main program collects information via a customer survey and stores the data in .txt files. 
The "Comment Portal" program accesses and displays that data. The program is able to assimilate the data into charts and reports that are then printed to a pdf printer.

  * Sold a program to a customer with first langauage i learned. 
  * Custom developed subroutines to creat bar graphs and pie charts. 
  * Learned event-driven programming, subroutine creation and use, and basic GUI comcepts.
